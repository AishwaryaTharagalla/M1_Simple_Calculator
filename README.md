# Simple Calculator 

## Introduction : 
A simple calculator is a calculator that helps people do arithmetic operations. This calculator allows users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics, they are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The numbers are given as the input and the number for the operation is then requested to enter, for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that patricular operation works. And this calculator is implemented with the order of precedence logic.
